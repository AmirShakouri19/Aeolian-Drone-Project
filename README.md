# Aeolian-Drone-Project
Drone is promissing for last-mile delivery application but inefficient in terms of energy consumption. This project aims at predicting and optimising drone's battery usage. The data used comes from a publicly published flight test study of drones. I have prepared and studied the data and used machine learning (XGBoost) and deep learning (LSTM) for modeling. I have also developed an app using the machine learning predictor model. For further explanation please refer to the Main.ipynb. The contents of this project is getting updated...
